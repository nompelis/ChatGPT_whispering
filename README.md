Examples of how I made ChatGPT do things for me, and random parts of know-how

This repository serves two purposes: (a) demonstrate my process of generating prompts for ChatGPT,
and (b) store all of the pieces of information and knowlede that I acquired as a result.

This is simply astounding. Embrace the new tools and prosper.

This repository was a good idea, but it is no longer going to maintain the text that was generated
by ChatGPT and the prompts provided. OpenAI now allows for users to make their chats with the agent
public on a URL. Moving forward, I will be putting a short description of my objective for a given
chat and the link to OpenAI's website. Expect a lot more content here as a result!
